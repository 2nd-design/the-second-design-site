### At howtocbc, we've made a decision to serve the Teacher-Creators community to the best of our efforts.

## Who are Teacher-Creators?

Teachers who have decided to become Creators, and Creators who have decided to become Teachers.

That's what we mean when we say Teacher-Creator.

While this is definitely a subset of the larger Creator Economy, we think that grouping together Teacher-Creators into a new sub-set is more meaningful. Being Teacher-Creators ourselves, we have a lot to offer to the Community.

## How are we helping Teacher-Creators at the moment?

- We run a Cohort-Based-Course that helps Teacher-Creators create their first CBC.
- We write a fortnightly newsletter sharing tips, tricks and best practises to help Teacher-Creators build better CBCs.
- We tweet out insights relevant to aspiring CBC creators occasionally.

Come join us in the conversation!
