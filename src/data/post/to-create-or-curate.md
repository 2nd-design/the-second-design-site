To Create or Curate content?

That is the question you may face as you create your [CBC Learning Unit](https://newsletter.howtocbc.com/issues/howtocbc-pulse-forget-lectures-think-learning-units-for-your-cbc-1179657).

How do you decide?


## How to curate well

For students, it’s the age of the Internet, one of information at their fingertips. The problem now is an abundance of information. And it is overwhelming.

It’s the same feeling one gets when confronted by ten different choices for milk at the supermarket. Suddenly, instead of simply drinking milk that the milkman gets to the door every morning, one is having to choose whether to have oat milk or almond milk or full fat or 2% or goat milk or cow’s milk or A1 or A2 milk.

What can an instructor do to make life easier for a student?

Point students to the most high impact, engaging and highest quality content. But throwing a book or YouTube videos at a student won’t suffice.

A teacher has to provide a map, some markers on the map, some goals and outcomes, and several pathways towards those outcomes. The point of content must be to help the student chart their own course and make their own mind maps.

So only content highly relevant to the student’s own learning goals / problem solutions need be curated and presented.

🥤 Consume well. Have an organised information capturing system that you can refer to and search from.

🗒️ Organise your curated lists around a theme or an outcome. How will a reader / student benefit from going through the curated material?

🙂 Only recommend content that you have personally consumed and benefited from. This will enrich your message.

🔭 Develop a Point of View. It’s the lens through which you view the world, and show your students. Be bold and creative as you build a story around your curation.

Examples of good curation can come from a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ayushtweetshere/status/1530538633995821056?s=19&t=Qo3c9YYe-e4DzFjBLO83_w&utm_campaign=howtocbc%20Pulse) or from a [music playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3C7FXzgUwDq7hY68lW5B2d?%24full_url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fplaylist%2F3C7FXzgUwDq7hY68lW5B2d%3Fsi%3D96321e63382548fb&_branch_match_id=3725985389773276344&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA7WN3wqCMByFn2ZeKm46LZCoxDeI6irm2nT4y639Iezpm0GPEJyLw%2Fn4OKP3xm2zzBntlVxSZkwKap6ynbH6HrhvtBFzgnAhA8AtWGjGVUFkj3AXs%2BL0Z3P9iJMBtoByPlZyrLrLezi92mc1XmkN5%2FKA74h0TiHSbijBuaCE1Lgsatl%2FbxhAz%2Fj05yuE6RxhmydSMB%2BsaLQd2Kz4B6%2F2y34RAQAA&feature=organic&nd=1&product=open&si=96321e63382548fb&utm_campaign=howtocbc%20Pulse&utm_medium=organic&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

👥 Curating others’ work can open up opportunities to network and collaborate with new creators.

💡 Curation exposes your students to valuable resources, people and perspectives in the field.

🥂 There is often a tendency to look down on curators as lacking in creativity or originality. Don’t let this bog you down. As a curator, you are a tastemaker. Use this opportunity to showcase your own outlook.

So in the modern age, when does one create content?

Create only when you have a Unique, Personal and Invaluable Point of View 🔍 that no one else in the world either has or is willing to share.

Let’s take an example. We are in the middle of running our cohort right now. What’s our most highly rated session so far? One where we took our students behind the scenes 🎬 and shared our own course review from cohort 1. We shared in great detail our goals, our hits, our misses, our revenues. As we shared the document we could also talk to them about our state of mind then, our priorities and how these have evolved over time.

People often learn best from examples. They see someone else do something, then imitate and then finally personalise it. From songbirds that imitate their parent birds to human children learning languages, we all learn by following an example.

And an example from YOUR own life is something that only YOU are an expert in 🤴. It is irreplaceable. It is a unique combination of your circumstances, actions and insights that you can crystallise into original content for your students to learn from.

If you’re wondering whether to create content to explain a topic, consider the following questions:

If your answers are NO❌ to the first two and YES✅ to the next two, go ahead and create your content.

Choose a favourite topic.
