Hello Teacher-Creators,

We hope you had a wonderful fortnight 😀

In the last newsletter we dove into the north star of Learner Centred Teaching, [Learner Outcomes](https://newsletter.howtocbc.com/issues/howtocbc-pulse-learner-outcomes-1024906). We hope you were able to write your own 💥 Learner Outcomes.

This time we present one of the most effective sets of tools available to a teacher-creator to help learners achieve their outcomes, 🏃 Active Learning.

[Active Learning](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/active-learning/) is a set of techniques of learning and teaching that engage learners through various tasks apart from simply listening to lectures.

These methods increase student participation in class and improve engagement with the learning material.

Because of the forgetting curve.

Research has shown that new information we receive immediately starts decaying from our memory, with [75% of new information we receive being lost in 6 days if not applied](https://www.sanidasacademy.com/journal/2020/2/28/the-forgetting-curve).

Crucially, for teachers and learners this means that passively listening to lectures is a tool mostly fit for short term learning and retention.

True long term learning only occurs if the knowledge gained is applied in various contexts.

We find that active learning methods are very effective when employed in class during live sessions.

To get started with incorporating active learning in class, ask yourself, what is the learner doing in class? Design your lesson plan to ensure that the learner is doing various tasks other than simply listening to someone lecture.

Below are examples of various tasks the learner could be engaged in. These range from simple activities to more complex ones.

🤫 Silent reflection. Give your learner a chance to absorb newly introduced complex ideas or insights.

🙋🏽 Participating in polls ([Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/4412325214477-Advanced-polling-and-quizzing-for-meetings), [Google Meet](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/10165071?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en&utm_campaign=howtocbc%20Pulse)) / responding in chat to ❓ Multiple Choice Questions. Good method to get a pulse of learner understanding and to gauge prior knowledge.

🎤 Unmuting mic to ask / answer questions.

✍️ Solo writing. This can be on paper or a shared [Google Doc workbook](https://docs.google.com/) etc.

👥 Brainstorming with peers in smaller groups. This can be accomplished using break out rooms ([Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476313), [Google Meet](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/10099500?hl=en&utm_campaign=howtocbc%20Pulse)).

🧙🦹 [Role play](https://ablconnect.harvard.edu/want-facilitate-role-playing-your-class).

🗣🗣 Group discussions / case studies after assigning reading / content viewing as an asynchronous activity before class.

👨‍🏫 Demonstrations. Our own [course on designing CBCs](https://maven.com/howtocbc/designacbc/) has a demonstration to the entire cohort as one of its learner outcomes.

Integrating active learning effectively in your teaching requires careful thought, and plenty of practice! Here are some tips we have found to be useful.

Have you used any of the tools in the CBC Active Learning toolkit yet?

✔ If yes, tell us about your experience!

🏁 If not, get started right away with how you could incorporate these methods in your courses!

💡 If you think we have missed any, tell us, and we will feature you and your input in our blog!

At howtocbc, we’re offering [a free 1 hour workshop](https://tally.so/r/mRQ4Pn) to a select audience to help you get started with Cohort Based Courses. Attend this workshop if you are -
